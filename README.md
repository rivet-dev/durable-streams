# Durable Stream

**Open protocol for real-time sync to client applications**

HTTP-based durable streams for streaming data reliably to web browsers, mobile apps, and native clients with offset-based resumability.

Durable Stream provides a simple, production-proven protocol for creating and consuming ordered, replayable data streams with support for catch-up reads and live tailing.

## The Missing Primitive

Modern applications frequently need ordered, durable sequences of data that can be replayed from arbitrary points and tailed in real time. Common patterns include:

- **AI conversation streaming** - Stream LLM token responses with resume capability across reconnections
- **Database synchronization** - Stream database changes to web, mobile, and native clients
- **Collaborative editing** - Sync CRDTs and operational transforms across devices
- **Real-time updates** - Push application state to clients with guaranteed delivery
- **Event sourcing** - Build event-sourced architectures with client-side replay
- **Workflow execution** - Stream workflow state changes with full history

While durable streams exist throughout backend infrastructure (database WALs, Kafka topics, event stores), they aren't available as a first-class primitive for client applications. There's no simple, HTTP-based durable stream that sits alongside databases and object storage as a standard cloud primitive.

Applications typically implement ad-hoc solutions for resumable streaming—combinations of databases, queues, polling mechanisms, and custom offset tracking. Most implementations handle reconnection poorly: streaming responses break when clients switch tabs, experience brief network interruptions, or refresh pages.

**Durable Stream addresses this gap.** It's a minimal HTTP-based protocol for durable, offset-based streaming designed for client applications across all platforms: web browsers, mobile apps, native clients, IoT devices, and edge workers. Based on 1.5 years of production use at Electric for real-time Postgres sync.

The protocol provides:

- 🌐 **Universal** - Works anywhere HTTP works: web browsers, mobile apps, native clients, IoT devices, edge workers
- 📦 **Simple** - Built on standard HTTP with no custom protocols
- 🔄 **Resumable** - Offset-based reads let you resume from any point
- ⚡ **Real-time** - Long-poll and SSE modes for live tailing with catch-up from any offset
- 💰 **Economical** - HTTP-native design leverages CDN infrastructure for efficient scaling
- 🎯 **Flexible** - Content-type agnostic byte streams
- 🔌 **Composable** - Build higher-level abstractions on top

## Quick Start

### Install the client

```bash
npm install @durable-stream/client
```

### Create and append to a stream

```typescript
import { DurableStream } from "@durable-stream/client"

// Create a new stream
const stream = await DurableStream.create({
  url: "https://your-server.com/v1/stream/my-stream",
  contentType: "application/json",
})

// Append data
await stream.append(JSON.stringify({ event: "user.created", userId: "123" }))
await stream.append(JSON.stringify({ event: "user.updated", userId: "123" }))
```

### Read from a stream

```typescript
// Catch-up read - get all existing data
const result = await stream.read()
console.log(new TextDecoder().decode(result.data))

// Live tail - follow new data as it arrives
for await (const chunk of stream.follow({ live: "long-poll" })) {
  console.log(new TextDecoder().decode(chunk.data))
}
```

### Resume from an offset

```typescript
// Read from a specific offset
const result = await stream.read({ offset: "0_100" })

// Resume live tail from where you left off
for await (const chunk of stream.follow({
  offset: result.offset,
  live: "long-poll",
})) {
  console.log(new TextDecoder().decode(chunk.data))
}
```

## Protocol

Durable Stream is built on a simple HTTP-based protocol. See [PROTOCOL.md](./PROTOCOL.md) for the complete specification.

**Core operations:**

- `PUT /stream/{path}` - Create a new stream
- `POST /stream/{path}` - Append bytes to a stream
- `GET /stream/{path}?offset=X` - Read from a stream (catch-up)
- `GET /stream/{path}?offset=X&live=long-poll` - Live tail (long-poll)
- `GET /stream/{path}?offset=X&live=sse` - Live tail (Server-Sent Events)
- `DELETE /stream/{path}` - Delete a stream
- `HEAD /stream/{path}` - Get stream metadata

**Key features:**

- Opaque, lexicographically sortable offsets for resumption
- Optional sequence numbers for writer coordination
- TTL and expiry time support
- Content-type preservation
- CDN-friendly caching and request collapsing

## Relationship to Backend Streaming Systems

Backend streaming systems like Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Kinesis excel at server-to-server messaging and backend event processing. Durable Stream complements these systems by solving a different problem: **reliably streaming data to client applications**.

The challenges of streaming to clients are distinct from server-to-server streaming:

- **Client diversity** - Supporting web browsers, mobile apps, native clients, each with different capabilities and constraints
- **Network unreliability** - Clients disconnect constantly (backgrounded tabs, network switches, page refreshes)
- **Resumability requirements** - Clients need to pick up exactly where they left off without data loss
- **Economics** - Per-connection costs make dedicated connections to millions of clients prohibitive
- **Protocol compatibility** - Kafka/AMQP protocols don't run in browsers or on most mobile platforms
- **Data shaping and authorization** - Backend streams typically contain raw, unfiltered events; client streams need per-user filtering, transformation, and authorization applied

**Complementary architecture:**

```
Kafka/RabbitMQ → Application Server → Durable Streams → Clients
(server-to-server)   (shapes data,      (server-to-client)
                      authorizes)
```

Your application server consumes from backend streaming systems, applies authorization logic, shapes data for specific clients, and fans out via Durable Streams. This separation allows:

- Backend systems to optimize for throughput, partitioning, and server-to-server reliability
- Application servers to enforce authorization boundaries and transform data
- Durable Streams to optimize for HTTP compatibility, CDN leverage, and client resumability
- Each layer to use protocols suited to its environment

## Running Your Own Server

### Node.js Reference Implementation

```bash
npm install @durable-stream/server
```

```typescript
import { createDurableStreamServer } from "@durable-stream/server"

const server = createDurableStreamServer({
  port: 8787,
  // In-memory storage (for development)
  // Add file-backed storage for production
})

await server.start()
```

See [@durable-stream/server](./packages/server) for more details.

### Other Implementations

The protocol is implementation-agnostic. You can:

- Build your own server in any language
- Use [@durable-stream/conformance-tests](./packages/conformance-tests) to verify compliance
- Run [@durable-stream/benchmarks](./packages/benchmarks) to measure performance

## CLI Tool

```bash
npm install -g @durable-stream/cli
```

```bash
# Create a stream
durable-stream create my-stream

# Write to a stream
echo "hello world" | durable-stream write my-stream

# Read from a stream
durable-stream read my-stream

# Delete a stream
durable-stream delete my-stream
```

## Use Cases

### Database Sync

Stream database changes to web and mobile clients for real-time synchronization:

```typescript
// Server: stream database changes
for (const change of db.changes()) {
  await stream.append(JSON.stringify(change))
}

// Client: receive and apply changes (works in browsers, React Native, native apps)
for await (const chunk of stream.follow({ live: "long-poll" })) {
  const change = JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(chunk.data))
  applyChange(change)
}
```

### Event Sourcing

Build event-sourced systems with durable event logs:

```typescript
// Append events
await stream.append(JSON.stringify({ type: "OrderCreated", orderId: "123" }))
await stream.append(JSON.stringify({ type: "OrderPaid", orderId: "123" }))

// Replay from beginning
const result = await stream.read({ offset: "0_0" })
const events = parseEvents(result.data)
const state = events.reduce(applyEvent, initialState)
```

### AI Conversation Streaming

Stream LLM responses with full conversation history accessible across devices:

```typescript
// Stream AI response chunks
for await (const token of llm.stream(prompt)) {
  await stream.append(token)
}

// Client can resume from any point (switch devices, refresh page, reconnect)
for await (const chunk of stream.follow({
  offset: lastSeenOffset,
  live: "sse",
})) {
  renderToken(new TextDecoder().decode(chunk.data))
}
```

## Testing Your Implementation

```typescript
import { runConformanceTests } from "@durable-stream/conformance-tests"

runConformanceTests({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8787",
})
```

## Benchmarking

Measure your server's performance:

```typescript
import { runBenchmarks } from "@durable-stream/benchmarks"

runBenchmarks({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8787",
  environment: "local",
})
```
